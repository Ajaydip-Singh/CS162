A normal queue has a front and a back and you can insert items from the back and remove items from the front.

A normal queue is a first in first out or in other words it is a FIFO queue.



A priority queue on the other hand does not really have a specified end, Thus, insertion does not happen at a specific end. When elements are inserted in a priority queue they can be inserted in any order. However, when they are removed, the removal depends on the priority/value assigned to it.


A LIFO on the other hand essentially means that the last iterm inputted is the first one that comes out. This is often how stacks work in example.
